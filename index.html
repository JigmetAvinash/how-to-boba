        <p>
            Making boba is not that hard, I know that most of us think that we are incapable of cooking, but let me just be the bridge to your self-confidence (or you got your boba ordered then this recipe can come in work later :D)

            I personally feel making boba is actually art (and skill to impress your crush) cause everyone loves em, here is what you will need
            <ul>
                <li><p><b>Boba drops</b></p>: 1/4 cup (store-bought tapioca pearls or jelly drops)</li>
                <li><p><b>Tea</b></p>: 1 cup (black tea, green tea, or any tea of your choice)</li>
                <li><p><b>Milk</b></p>: 1/2 cup (whole milk, oat milk, almond milk, or any milk of your choice)</li>
                <li><p><b>Sweetener</b></p>: 2-3 tbsp (sugar, honey, or condensed milk)</li>
                <li><p><b>Ice</b></p>: (or maybe not, come on its winter right now!)</li>

                
            </ul>

            Now that you have your ingredients, let's make some boba! Follow these simple steps:
            <ol>
                <li><b>Cook the Boba Drops:</b> Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the boba drops and stir gently to prevent sticking. Cook for 3-5 minutes (or according to the package instructions). Drain and rinse with cold water. Mix with 1-2 tbsp of sugar or honey to sweeten.</li>
                <li><b>Brew the Tea:</b> Brew 1 cup of tea of your choice. While itâ€™s still warm, add your preferred sweetener (sugar, honey, or condensed milk) and stir until dissolved. Let it cool.</li>
                <li><b>Assemble Your Drink:</b> In a glass, add the sweetened boba drops at the bottom. Fill the glass halfway with ice if desired. Pour the cooled tea over the ice, and top it off with milk for creaminess.</li>
                <li><b>Optional:</b> Garnish with whipped cream, a drizzle of caramel or chocolate, or fruit slices if youâ€™d like.</li>
            </ol>
            Your homemade boba tea is ready to enjoy! ðŸ§‹
